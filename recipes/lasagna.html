    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can
        also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel
        sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <pre>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.

        Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.

        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.

        Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.

        Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        
        Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        
        Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
        
        Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</pre>
